The simulation take place on a grid.

Time goes by in 15 minutes increments.
A day lasts 96 steps.

Agents stay in their home cell until the visiting hour of an activity is reached. They then go to the cell of that activity and only return back to their home cell once the visit time is over. Agents render themselves transparent to travel from cell to cell in order not to make it seem like they are visiting all cells they go over.
<TODO - condition for agents to test and heal themselves>



Cell types:
 - Home
 - School
 - Essential activity
 - Non-essential activity
 - Screening center
 - Vaccination center



Globale variables:
 - Week number (integer)
 - Day (integer : 1 - 7)
 - Hour (float : 0.0 - 23.75)



Agents' common properties:
 - Home cell (integer)
 - Non-essential activity list (array with three lines of integers: activity number, visit starting hour, visit time limit)
 - Essential activity list (tableau à trois lignes d'entiers: activity number, visit starting hour, visit time limit)
 - Health state (enumerator: susceptible, sick, vaccined, healed, deceased)
 - Contact case (number of days; integer: 0 - +infinity)
 - Incubation (number of days; integer: 0 - 14)
 - Symptomatic (boolean)
 - Level of trust (float: 0.0 - 1.0)
 - Level of altruism (float: 0.0 - 1.0)
 - Level of morale (float: 0.0 - 1.0)
 - Level of virus existence belief (float: 0.0 - 1.0)
 - Level of virus transmission belief (float: 0.0 - 1.0)
 - Level of virus lethality belief (float: 0.0 - 1.0)
 - At-risk (boolean)
 - Mask compliance (boolean)

Child agent caracteristics:
 - Much less susceptible to virus symptoms
 - Information access mainly through social media

Adult agent caracteristics:
<TODO>

Old agent caracteristics:
 - Mainly at risk
 - Information access mainly through news channels



Agents' common graphic aspect properties:
 - Colour according to health state
 - Pattern if mask not worn

Child agent graphic aspect caracteristics:
 - Triangle shape

Adult agent graphic aspect caracteristics:
 - Circle shape

Old agent graphic aspect caracteristics:
 - Square shape



Possible actions:
Actions can be based on agent type.
Actions can be based on at-risk agent property.

General initialisation:
 - Creation of the grid
 - Number of steps initialised to 0
 - Time initialised to Monday (1), week 0, schedule 0.0
 - Creation of agents on home cells (minimum 1 adult or old person per cell)
