The simulation take place on a grid.

Time goes by in 15 minutes increments.
A day lasts 96 steps.

Agents stay in their home cell until the visiting hour of an activity is reached. They then go to the cell of that activity and only return back to their home cell once the visit time is over. Agents render themselves transparent to travel from cell to cell in order not to make it seem like they are visiting all cells they go over.
